# C++ SStdLib

A substandard library for C++, containing some random functions for convenience

## How to use

1. Download distributable from `Releases` section
2. Unzip it.

If you are using a compiler (e.g. GNU/g++, LLVM/clang), add the following flag when compiling `-I path/to/library/sstd`. This sstd should be the working directory of the library, not the include directory of the library.

If you are using an IDE (e.g. code::blocks), go to compiler settings -> additional include paths and add `path/to/library/sstd` to it. For instructions specific to your IDE, please visit the IDE's documentation.

## Minimum C++ version

I don't know, probably around 2020 to be safe.
